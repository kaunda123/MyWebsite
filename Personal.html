                The man is the one the only man that can destroy all humanity.
                All my years of conquest,slaugter,it wasnt personal but i tell you now what i am about to do to your annoying little planet I am going to enjoy it very very much.You should have some level of Python coding experience to make the most of this book.
                Although the book assumes no previous Flask knowledge, Python concepts such as
                packages, modules, functions, decorators, and object-oriented programming are as
               sumed to be well understood. Some familiarity with exceptions and diagnosing issues
                from stack traces will be very useful.
                While working through the examples in this book, you will spend a great deal of time
                in the command line. You should feel comfortable using the command line of your
                operating system.
                Modern web applications cannot avoid the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
                example application that is developed throughout the book obviously makes use of
                these, but the book itself does not go into a lot of detail regarding these technologies
                and how they are used. Some degree of familiarity with these languages is recommended
                if you intend to develop complete applications without the help of a developer versed
                in client-side techniques.
                I released the companion application to this book as open source on GitHub. Although
                GitHub makes it possible to download applications as regular ZIP or TAR files, I strongly
                recommend that you install a Git client and familiarize yourself with source code version
                control, at least with the basic commands to clone and check out the different versions
                of the application directly from the repository. The short list of commands that you’ll
                need is shown in “How to Work with the Example Code ” on page xiii. You will want to
                use version control for your own projects as well, so use this book as an excuse to learn
                Git!
                Finally, this book is not a complete and exhaustive reference on the Flask framework.
                Most features are covered, but you should complement this book with the official Flask
                documentation.
                How This Book Is Organized
                This book is divided into three parts:
                Part I, Introduction to Flask, explores the basics of web application development with
                the Flask framework and some of its extensions:
                • Chapter 1 describes the installation and setup of the Flask framework.
                • Chapter 2 dives straight into Flask with a basic application.
                • Chapter 3 introduces the use of templates in Flask applications.
                • Chapter 4 introduces web forms.
                • Chapter 5 introduces databases.
                xii 
               | 
               Preface
               • Chapter 6 introduces email support.
                • Chapter 7 presents an application structure that is appropriate for medium and
                large applications.
                Part II, Example: A Social Blogging Application, builds Flasky, the open source blogging
                and social networking application that I developed for this book:
                • Chapter 8 implements a user authentication system.
                • Chapter 9 implements user roles and permissions.
                • Chapter 10 implements user profile pages.
                • Chapter 11 creates the blogging interface.
                • Chapter 12 implements followers.
                • Chapter 13 implements user comments for blog posts.
                • Chapter 14 implements an Application Programming Interface (API).
                Part III, The Last Mile, describes some important tasks not directly related to application
                coding that need to be considered before publishing an application:
                • Chapter 15 describes different unit testing strategies in detail.
                • Chapter 16 gives an overview of performance analysis techniques.
                • Chapter 17 describes deployment options for Flask applications, both traditional
                and cloud based.
                • Chapter 18 lists additional resources.
                How to Work with the Example Code 
               The code examples presented in this book are available from GitHub at https://
                github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky.
                The commit history in this repository was carefully created to match the order in which
                concepts are presented in the book. The recommended way to work with the code is to
                check out the commits starting from the oldest, then move forward through the commit
                list as you make progress with the book. As an alternative, GitHub will also let you
                download each commit as a ZIP or TAR file.
                If you decide to use Git to work with the source code, then you need to install the Git
                client, which you can download from http://git-scm.com. The following command
                downloads the example code using Git:
                $ git clone https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky.git
                Preface 
               | 
               xiii
               The git clone command installs the source code from GitHub into a flasky folder that
                is created in the current directory. This folder does not contain just source code; a copy
                of the Git repository with the entire history of changes made to the application is also
                included.
                In the first chapter you will be asked to check out the initial release of the application,
                and then, at the proper places you will be instructed to move forward in the history.
                The Git command that lets you move through the change history is git checkout. Here
                is an example:
                $ git checkout 1a
                The 1a referenced in the command is a tag, a named point in the history of the project.
                This repository is tagged according to the chapters of the book, so the 1a tag used in
                the example sets the application files to the initial version used in Chapter 1. Most
                chapters have more than one tag associated with them, so, for example, tags 5a, 5b, and
                so on are incremental versions presented in Chapter 5.
                In addition to checking out the source files for a version of the application, you may
                need to perform some setup. For example, in some cases you will need to install addi
               tional Python packages or apply updates to the database. You will be told when these
                are necessary.
                You will normally not modify the source files of the application, but if you do, then Git
                will not let you check out a different revision, as that would cause your local changes to
                be lost. Before you can check out a different revision, you will need to revert the files to
                their original state. The easiest way to do this is with the git reset command:
                $ git reset --hard
                This command will destroy your local changes, so you should save anything you don’t
                want to lose before you use this command.
                From time to time, you may want to refresh your local repository from the one on
                GitHub, where bug fixes and improvements may have been applied. The commands
                that achieve this are:
                $ git fetch --all
                $ git fetch --tags
                $ git reset --hard origin/master
                The git fetch commands are used to update the commit history and the tags in your
                local repository from the remote one on GitHub, but none of this affects the actual
                source files, which are updated with the git reset command that follows. Once again,
                be aware that any time git reset is used you will lose any local changes you have made.
                Another useful operation is to view all the differences between two versions of the
                application. This can be very useful to understand a change in detail. From the command
                xiv 
               | 
               Preface
               line, the git diff command can do this. For example, to see the difference between
                revisions 2a and 2b, use:
                $ git diff  2a 2b
                The differences are shown as a patch, which is not a very intuitive format to review
                changes if you are not used to working with patch files. You may find that the graphical
                comparisons shown by GitHub are much easier to read. For example, the differences
                between revisions 2a and 2b can be viewed on GitHub at https://github.com/miguelgrin
                berg/flasky/compare/2a...2b
                Using Code Examples
                This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if example code is offered
                with this book, you may use it in your programs and documentation. You do not need

                Acknowledgments
                I could not have written this book alone. I have received a lot of help from family, co
               workers, old friends, and new friends I’ve made along the way.
                I’d like to thank Brendan Kohler for his detailed technical review and for his help in
                giving shape to the chapter on Application Programming Interfaces. I’m also in debt to
                David Baumgold, Todd Brunhoff, Cecil Rock, and Matthew Hugues, who reviewed the
                manuscript at different stages of completion and gave me very useful advice regarding
                what to cover and how to organize the material.
                Writing the code examples for this book was a considerable effort. I appreciate the help
                of Daniel Hofmann, who did a thorough code review of the application and pointed out
                several improvements. I’m also thankful to my teenage son, Dylan Grinberg, who sus
               pended his Minecraft addiction for a few weekends and helped me test the code under
                several platforms.
                O’Reilly has a wonderful program called Early Release that allows impatient readers to
                have access to books while they are being written. Some of my Early Release readers
                went the extra mile and engaged in useful conversations regarding their experience
                working through the book, leading to significant improvements. I’d like to acknowledge

               Sundeep Gupta, Dan Caron, Brian Wisti and Cody Scott in particular for the contri

                The staff at O’Reilly Media has always been there for me. Above all I’d like to recognize
                my wonderful editor, Meghan Blanchette, for her support, advice, and assistance from
                the very first day we met. Meg has made the experience of writing my first boo
